# JDBC_connection
Testing JDBC connection
For this project I have added my own table for a database that has to do with the College I went to. My table had to deal with the all the buildings in the school as their abbreviated versions were already in the database. My table had the written out version that properly links to their abbreviated versions. Unfortunately, after the semester has ended, my professor has withdrawn my access to the database.
